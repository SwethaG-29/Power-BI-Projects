📶 Excited to share my another project in Power BI! 🚀. Your thoughts and feedback are greatly appreciated! 🙌

 
🔍 Key Insights from My Analysis:
1️⃣ Loan Amount Funnel Performance: Out of the total applied loan amount of 245K, 87% is sanctioned, 92% is disbursed, but only 53% is recovered. This indicates a significant gap in the recovery process, potentially impacting financial stability.
2️⃣ Loan Amount Trend Analysis: The applied loan amount shows significant fluctuations, with a peak of 8.1K in July 2019. This suggests seasonal variations or economic conditions influencing loan demand over time.
3️⃣ Top Products Sold: The most popular product is Loans + Group Insurance (62K), followed by Loans + Top-up (61K), indicating a strong preference for bundled products with additional benefits.
4️⃣ Channel Distribution: The majority of loans are sourced through online channels (36.46%), highlighting the increasing trend towards digital application processes, with walk-ins (24.8%) and tie-ups (13.82%) trailing behind.
5️⃣ Key Influencers for High Loan Amounts: Age group 26-32 has a 2.15x likelihood of applying for a higher loan amount, while online channels and the Bhopal branch are other key factors driving higher loan amounts.

🔧 Tools Used in This Project:
  1. 📊 Power BI: For data visualization, report creation, and interactive dashboards.
  2. 🧮 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): To perform complex calculations and aggregations.
  3. 🗂 Data Modelling: To create relationships between different data tables for structured analysis.
  4. 🔄 Power Query: For data transformation, cleaning, and preparation.
  5. 🔍 Key Influencers Visualization: To identify and display factors impacting loan amounts.


💡 Future Recommendations :
  • Enhance Recovery Processes: Implement strategies to increase the recovery rate to match the high disbursement and sanction percentages.
  • Focus on Online Channel Optimization: Given the high volume of loans from online channels, further enhancing digital customer experiences could increase loan applications.
  • Develop Age-Specific Loan Products: Create targeted loan products or marketing campaigns for the 26-32 age group to leverage their high likelihood of applying for larger loan amounts.🔥
