🕵️‍♂️ Key Insights from My Super Store Sales Dashboard Analysis:

1️⃣ Sales by Payment Mode: Cash on Delivery COD (43%) dominates payment preferences, followed by online transactions (35%), indicating a customer preference for both cash-based and digital transactions.

2️⃣ Sales by Region: The West region (14%) leads in sales, while the South region (7%) shows lower performance, highlighting regional discrepancies that may benefit from tailored marketing strategies.

3️⃣ Sales by Segment: The Consumer segment (21%) is the top performer, with Corporate (13%) and Home Office (8%) trailing, suggesting opportunities to strengthen corporate and home office sales.

4️⃣ Sales by State: California (0.34M) is the top-performing state, followed by New York (0.19M) and Texas (0.12M), suggesting areas where sales strategies can be optimized or expanded.

 

💡 Future Recommendations:

1. Focus marketing efforts on underperforming regions like the South.

2. Expand Same Day delivery services to meet potential demand.

3. Develop initiatives to boost Corporate and Home Office segment sales.

4. Analyse the success of top-selling categories (Office Supplies) and replicate strategies for others.

5. Standard Class is the most popular shipping mode, incentivising faster shipping options through promotions or loyalty programs could increase customer satisfaction and profitability. 🎯
